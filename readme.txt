PROJECT TITLE       :   Hostel Management
PROJECT MEMBERS     :   Mohamed Riswan, Mohamed Faisal
PROJECT INSTRUCTOR  :   Dr. R Shriram

DESCRIPTION:
	 This particular project deals with the problems on managing a hostel and avoids the problems which occur when carried manually. Identification of the drawbacks of the existing system leads to the designing of computerized system that will be compatible to the existing system with the system Which is more user friendly and more GUI oriented. We can improve the efficiency of the system, thus overcome the drawbacks of the existing system.
That's all about our site in a nutshell. To see more, you can use the instructions given below to set it up on your local machine. This project has been developed as a part of the curriculum for the course CS405

INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Once you have cloned the repo to your local machine, you can run them after putting them in a local server such as a wamp server or xampp server.
    2. Open the location of the www or htdocs folder from the installation directory of wamp or xampp respectively. Copy the files from repo to that directory. Creating an additional folder makes it easy for you to organize them later on when you add in more projects.
    3. After ensuring that the server is running, navigate to phpmyadmin to give connections to the database. You can use the sql file available in the repo to import the necessary tables for this system.
    4. Now you can view the site in all its glory by navigating to the index file from the web browsers search bar. It should look something similar to this - localhost/folder_name/index.php
    5. That's all folks :)
